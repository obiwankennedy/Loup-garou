If you are able to defend the site, item, or person, you gain a full Rank of Glory. While attempting to defend, you are Heavily Engaged and must fight 3-6 enemies of your Insight Rank or higher.

If you do succeed in defeating them before they reach the Reserves, you gain one point of Glory for each soldier defeated.
